        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am AMBATI VYSHNAVI. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of creativity and problem-solving that engineering offers.
            I was always drawn to how things work, whether it was taking apart gadgets or building contraptions from scratch. This innate curiosity led me to pursue a degree in COMPUTER SCIENCE  at RAMIREDDY SUBBARAMI REDDY ENGINEERING COLLEGE.
            Throughout my academic journey, I've had the opportunity to delve into various facets of engineering, from theoretical concepts to hands-on projects. I have a particular interest in FRONTEND AND BACKEND, where I've been able to apply my knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.
            Outside of the classroom, I'm actively involved in NSS, where I've honed my leadership and teamwork skills while collaborating on innovative projects. These experiences have not only enriched my academic learning but also reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact through engineering.
            Looking ahead, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my engineering career. Whether it's developing sustainable solutions for environmental issues or pushing the boundaries of technology, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to create a better future for all.</p>
